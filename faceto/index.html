                    <b>W</b>ith this program you are free to think but you are not ready to face, isn't it? Your home and your schools where you acquire wisdom and knowledge, your friends teaching you what is life, are different than what you find on Youtube, if it's not the music. What about let some comments that will not been removed on videos making you raging because guys behind it on Youtube know nothing about the reality, and they don't want to ear that because they think they are perfect. Let your truth exprims, or simply face to the reality, why not? The program is for linking videos you can watch, and let your comments on it. There a search tool with words on name of channels and on title of videos to find easy all videos already commented on a channel or a subject, by other users and you. It's annonymous but you can view all hilarious comments of a same user on a video. But don't worry if you regret something, you can still remove your own comments easily. It's uncensored, but I don't accept to destroy the program with spaming and phishing, so in this both cases only, I shall remove comments. Let's see...

                    <b>L</b>ife isn't people, it's always good to know the truth, self learning have the last word at the end. Discharge your hate in the program, and know yourself. It's made for it. I made the program also as web applications with Firebase, and .NET. It could exist with my own framework named OSEF for Optimized and Simple Enhanced Framework, but apparently it's witout any interest.
