                    <b>T</b>he program is a simple tool for get ride of cheaters eveywhere and everytime. It stands on one side server where cheaters can cheat freely, and on one side where players can play freely. All multiplayer games have hacked servers, and official servers. But there are official servers worst than hacked servers. It consist of setup a firewall for the game play that deserve to be play, and a automatic research which add firewall rules when you play. With it, you will find what is the game play, and so enjoy it fully, playing on official servers. Let's see...

                    <b>I</b>t needs you tune the firewall used, when you want to play other games. But with the setup button all the firewall rules for the game are automatically created. There isn't any conflict with rules for all your other games. You just need to delete rules added with the automatic search which create specific rules. When you want to play the game play, hit the start button, becoming the stop button. In resume, it create firewall rules like for <a href="firewallsimplerules.wfw" download>Edge firewall</a> with a PC connected to Wi-Fi, and like for <a href="firewallcod.wfw" download>Call of Duty firewall</a> with a PC connected to Ethernet, to import and adapt from Windows Firewall. It need to set IPv4 properties manually, and having a local administrator account session for your PC. You can open task manager (ctrl + shift + esc) for localize Edge and Call of Duty.
