                    <b>T</b>he program is made for stop useless programs. The program itself is optimized. It's used while playing. There's nothing to do, only starting the program. The game you playing is feeling more optimized and so responsive. Let's see...

                <p>
                    <b>T</b>he program need to set a white list of process to keep running, but it's helped by a record of process stoped by the program. The list is already well completed. It's more simple as it seem to setup, despite with these words. Under same folder of the program you find two text files, the white list to complete and the record of stoped process. Some services like Nvidia container is always trying to start, so it require to disable the service from administrative tools under control panel. You can download the <a href="StopIt.zip" download>sdk and program</a> in release folder, to unzip. It always need to restart the program after changes in the white list text file. I have a <a href="siwhitelist.txt" download>white list</a> text file dedicated to Call of Duty.
