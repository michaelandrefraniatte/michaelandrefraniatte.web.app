                    <b>W</b>ith this program, you have all videos and songs on Youtube in one place. All channels or videos or playlists or search links, you add, and all recorded songs, you add, are easy to access without you need to connect on Youtube. You can add every of that on 2 pages. When you positioning your mouse cursor on bottom of the program, a menu barre is appearing. Here, there are several buttons... For close the program, for minimize the program, for go backward, for go forward, for open the page of links, for reload the page, for go on a link, then there is a box for put the link to go, and also the buttons, for record audio, for open a tuner audio, for open the page of songs, for clear cache of the browser, and finally the current time of the day.

                <p>
                    <b>T</b>he program is only in fullscreen window. After recorded a song, the directory of corresponding file is automatically open. You can uninstall the tuner audio, simply the button to open it, will be disable. Despite this program, I made a Edge extension to cut ads on Youtube named <a href="noads-extension.zip" download>noads-extension</a> to unzip. The extension can be installed from <a target="_blank" href="edge://extensions/">edge://extensions/</a>. The extension must be open each time you load a new tab or reload a page. It skipping almost all ads in times, ads are far less invasive. I also made a dedicated web browser for listen music on <a href="http://www.deezer.com/">Deezer</a> named Playzer. The song recording is also available in a dedicated program. I also made a personnal <a href="recipe.html" download>recipe</a> to add to favorites in Edge for surfing on Youtube with simple changes in HTML. I also made the Edge extension named <a href="recipe-extension.zip" download>recipe-extension</a> to unzip. The extension can be installed from <a target="_blank" href="edge://extensions/">edge://extensions/</a>. You can download the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/michaelandrefraniatte/webViewer">sdk and program</a> in release folder. There's a <a href="https://github.com/michaelandrefraniatte">License</a>.
