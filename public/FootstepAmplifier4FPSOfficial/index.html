You can download the <a href="VirtualBassSpeaker.zip" download>sdk and program</a> in release folder, to unzip. It's made if you have a laptop PC and external speakers as default peripheral for listen music. The internal speakers of your laptop PC are used as bass speaker. Both external and internal speakers must be enable, and level of earing well adapted. If you encounter issue while using the program, you can delete tempsave file under same folder of the program. If you set default speakers and level of earing to 0, the internal speakers of your laptop PC, the program task as an equalizer. By the what, you can have several Bluetooth speakers connected to your laptop PC, and then forward like this the sound by opening several times the program and choosing which speakers to control the sound out, in order to listen the sound simultaneously on several speakers, without the need of other program or method that would be invasive. If you have external speakers to ear virtual sound and a sound barre to virtualize bass, it's a must have. To note, the changes in equalizer settings take effect when you click on the start button, not in real time.
