                    <b>T</b>he folder of the program contains a background image file for change it with your own image like a stared black sky. You can remove a favour or a content in a favour easy, because when you click on a picture, it copy in clipboard, the picture link, and like for video, you can open it in your favorite browser. You can add without any limits. You need to accept Youtube RGPD. You can try the web version of <a href="/my-favours/">my-favours</a>. I also made the Edge extension named <a href="my-favours-extension.zip" download>my-favours-extension.zip</a> to unzip. The extension can be installed from <a target="_blank" href="edge://extensions/">edge://extensions/</a>. It's made to use on top of Youtube like the program, but it don't allow to cut ads unlike the program. You can try my gallery by opening the <a href="my-favours.txt" download>example</a> containing my list of contents and favours. Take care to always open the extension under same site because it use localstorage for saving the gallery. When you let a few times the cursor on buttons, you can see information bubbles, explaining the use of it. This <a href="content-id.txt" download>file</a> is explaining the way to get content id, in order to add pictures in my-favours with links under your Google Drive.
