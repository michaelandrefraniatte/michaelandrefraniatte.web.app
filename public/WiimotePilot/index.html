                    <b>T</b>he program allow to use Wiimote and Joycon left in FPS games with easy Configurations. It change in the game as soon as you change Configurations in the program. It's easy to understand and easy to win with this program. You can play all your FPS games the way you want if the Xbox controller is well supported in. Let's see...

                <p>
                    <b>I</b> can give you some Configurations examples and helping you. Even making for you some Configurations, even some dedicated programs around your Configurations or what you really want. Theres's a driver of old generation to install manually, and another to reorder All your Physical and Virtual Controllers from joy.cpl (Win + R). You can watch what I already guess about a <a href="../soul-controller-wiijoy/">soul-controller</a>. Unfortunately, it don't run with game launchers when they support controllers, like for Joycons and Pro Controller, inducing lags. It's actually the cases with Steam and Epic Games Launcher, and I don't have any workout or power to solve the issues. Normally, you need to uncheck support of controllers under options of Big Pictures under Steam, and for Epic Games Launcher, you need to close it after starting a game, and start the program only after. You need to set dot, instead of comma, as decimal separator from regional options under control panel. Download the <a href="ScpDriver.zip" download>ScpDriver.zip</a> to unzip and install as generic driver from peripheral manager under control panel. Download the <a href="Devreorder.zip" download>Devreorder.zip</a> to unzip, follow the instructions in, if you need to hide default controller for some games. After the program start, you shall put Joycon left and Wiimote in pairing mode, by pressing the buttons to connect it via Bluetooth. The connection is automatic with just that, and the disconnection is totally automatic after you close the program. If you are interested in other programs like this one, check the presentation of <a href="../ControllerSupport/">supporting controllers</a>.
