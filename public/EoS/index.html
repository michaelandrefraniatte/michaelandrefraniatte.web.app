                    <b>W</b>ith the equations in this program, coming from Soave-Redlich-Kwong, some other very old authors and me, in 2009, I modelized and then synthetized, for the first time, in a little hydrothermal system, reproducing gas generation (as I was a student in a laboratory working on Origin of Life, but alone to work on my PhD), in pure quantity, and at 250°C and 140 bars, the molecule of Origin Of Life: The Acridine Orange. It's the organic molecule where any other can be derived. It increases Lifetime and is able to generate ADN, because it can replicate. I synthetised a lot of pure molecules from easy calculation with this program. It found statistic volume of atmosphere and ocean like on Earth. It prooves that ice on Mars have something under totally different than ice and in big quantities like an atmosphere. I applied perfectly calculations, and from original equations, I made only 2 changes, empirically and theorically prooven from very old authors and my works with a new mathematical hypothesis I found. I was able to resolve derivation of all polynomial equations, resolve all polynomial equations with a hand pen, all differential equations better than with CNP functions which is a wrong method, all eletrochemical potentials, define all diffusion coefficients of materials from diffusion profil, find the properties of 2 unknown constituents, all PVTX data, PT traject of all fluid inclusions, solubilities of all constituents in all fluids, proove the equality of pressures from each side of a membrane, proove that any molecule pure in a closed system are stabilized at any temperature and any pressure, resolve all chemical reactions, synthetise easy any molecules and find all properties of molecules from my modelizations, but scientific community screamed on me and my own knowledges, and then pushed me out. Instead of pay me, they printed on papers all my researches and asked my PC passwords. I had to become homeless and foodless without my parents. In 2009, my contribution was to make working Equation of State method for all chemical Reactions, and in all environements without any fake idea, after 50 years of copy/paste wrong articles without any interest, if I did not do that.

                    <b>H</b>ave fun with the several CSV files I give with the program. Have fun to modelize and synthetize everything, have fun to discover responses to the unviversal Universe, just thinking that in a closed system (which is open on itselve), gas molecules and liquid molecules are in same number for a given constituent, so the system itselve is half gas and half liquid, and gas can be more dense than liquid. The program is illustrating with the following 4 pictures, where Acridine Orange synthesis is taken in example. Let's see...

                    <b>S</b>cientific community believes to equality of chemical potentials from each edge of a membrane. Hydrogen diffusion through a membrane for 10 bars, mixing with argon at 500 bars, make increase the total pressure to 513 bars because for them hydrogen have a fugacity coefficient of 1.3. But everyone can understand that argon has less space making argon to be at 503 bars. From each edge of a membrane it's the equality of pressures, not of fugacities as they thinking. If it was the equality of fugacities why hydrogen alone in the system would not be at 13 bars? Very old authors are all dead, and people think only new and all new articles are true, old are wrong. What I made and found are theorically, experimentally, and empirically prooven, and modelize the entire matter in the Universe.
