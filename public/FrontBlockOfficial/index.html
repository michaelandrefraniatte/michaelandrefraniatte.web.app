                    <b>T</b>he game I imagined is a table game, where players must have more positions to win. Each player goes by 2 positions from left to right for first player, and right to left for the second player... Each position are consecutive or not, but consecutive after each turn, advancing position by position. When a player attacks to front the other player(s), he wins two positions to play as follow. The winner of victory is the player who has more positions. Let's see...

                    <b>T</b>he color can be undo, but it counts as one position done. Prefer that, the player who undo a color corresponds to the player who has this color, when it's his turn so. No, it's a joke, the player color can be undo by the player when it's his turn. It doesn't change the playing match. You can try the web version of <a href="/FrontBlock/">FrontBlock</a>. You can download the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/michaelandrefraniatte/FrontBlock">sdk and program</a> in release folder. To note, a click on the position where to place the pion is required. Also, the program is only adapted for a resolution of 1366 per 768 pixels. There's a <a href="https://github.com/michaelandrefraniatte">License</a>.
